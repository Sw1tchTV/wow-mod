// File: effects.txt
// Author: Stinkyfax (aka jozh)
// Description: Here you can add/edit/delete effects DB.
// slots: weapon - 1,
// effect 2 - bloodthirst, settings in spell_1_3
// effect 3 - evade, settings in spell_2_1
// effect 4 - deadly poison for rogue
// effect 5 - absorb shield
// effect 7 - peppermint cakes
// Supported effect Events:
// Attacker
// Victim
// SpellAtt
// SpellVic
// use (hardly supported yet :( )

//Since version 1.21
//Effects > 100 are multi-effects, mainly used for enchanting
//Each 100th id has his own multi-effect source
//So for example 101 and 199 effects differ only in settings, not the code
//200 differs in code from 101 and 199
//To add new effect which uses existing "multi code" you don't need to
//modify source, hence is easy to add special effects for enchants.
//do not forget to add translations for effects!
